            About us
            <br>
            <br>
            We are three computer scientist students and also dads.<br>
            Jeffrey a backend specialist who have two daughters<br>
            Jeppe a fullstack developer who has a boy<br>
            Christopher a Designer who has two boys.<br>

            We have been assigned a task to create a project calculation and management tool,
            that can give a better overview and understanding, of the timeframe and cost of a big project.
            By breaking it down to task and subtasks.
